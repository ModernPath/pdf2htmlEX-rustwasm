# HTML Rendering Engine: Code Structure Documentation

## Overview
The HTML Rendering Engine subsystem is responsible for converting PDF content structures into semantic HTML DOM elements. Based on the provided module documentation, the codebase is explicitly organized into two primary locations:

1.  **`src/HTMLRenderer`**
2.  **`test`**

Detailed internal structures for these directories are not provided in the available documentation.

## Directory Structure

The following directory structure is explicitly supported by the provided module documentation:

```text
html-rendering-engine/
├── src/
│   └── HTMLRenderer/          # Explicitly referenced in module docs
└── test/                      # Explicitly referenced in module docs
```

### Directory Details

*   **`src/HTMLRenderer`**
    *   **Description:** Identified as the primary source directory for the HTML Rendering Engine.
    *   **Internal Structure:** Not determined from available documentation. The provided summary contains only the directory path and title.

*   **`test`**
    *   **Description:** Identified as the directory containing test suites.
    *   **Internal Structure:** Not determined from available documentation. The provided summary contains only the directory path and title.

## Key Components and Responsibilities

*Not determined from available documentation.*

While the subsystem description outlines high-level responsibilities—such as interpreting PDF graphics state, converting text/images to HTML/CSS, extracting embedded fonts, and rendering interactive elements—the provided module documentation does not map these responsibilities to specific files, classes, or modules within the `src/HTMLRenderer` directory.

## Dependencies and Integrations

*Not determined from available documentation.*

The provided module documentation does not list external dependencies, import statements, or library references. The "technologies" list in the subsystem information is empty.

## Architectural Patterns

*Not determined from available documentation.*

No specific code patterns, layering strategies, or architectural decisions (e.g., MVC, functional, component-based) are visible in the provided module documentation summaries.

## Entry Points

*Not determined from available documentation.*

No specific entry point files (e.g., `index.js`, `main.go`, `app.ex`) or build configurations are identified in the provided data.
