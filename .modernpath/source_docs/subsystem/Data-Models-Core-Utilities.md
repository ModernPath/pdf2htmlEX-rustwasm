# Data Models Documentation: Core Utilities

## Subsystem Overview
The Core Utilities subsystem is defined as providing "shared helper functions, data structures, and common logic used across the application." While the subsystem description explicitly identifies the provision of **data structures** as a key responsibility, the provided module documentation does not contain the specific definitions, schemas, or code implementations required to document these models in detail.

The provided module documentation consists only of the following entries:
*   `Data Models: src/util`
*   `Data Models: src`

Neither entry contains explicit definitions of entities, attributes, or relationships.

## Data Models & Schemas
**Status:** Not determined from available documentation.

The provided module documentation does not define specific database schemas, tables, or structured data types. While the subsystem is responsible for "data structures," the explicit fields, properties, and composition of these structures are not present in the provided text.

## Entity Relationships
**Status:** Not determined from available documentation.

There are no explicit relationship definitions (e.g., one-to-many, foreign keys, or associations) available in the provided module documentation.

## Data Validation Rules
**Status:** Not determined from available documentation.

Although the subsystem responsibilities include "Unicode mapping, validation," the specific validation rules, constraints, or schema validations are not explicitly defined in the provided data.

## Persistence & Storage
**Status:** Not determined from available documentation.

The provided documentation does not specify persistence mechanisms, database interactions, or storage patterns for the data structures within the Core Utilities subsystem.

## External Dependencies & Integrations
Based solely on the subsystem responsibilities, the Core Utilities subsystem interacts with the following domains. However, the specific data models or interfaces used for these integrations are not defined in the provided module documentation:

*   **Filesystem:** Responsible for path manipulation and parsing.
*   **FontForge Library:** Handles font processing via a C-wrapper.
*   **Geometry:** Performs matrix transformations and bounding box calculations.

*Note: The above list reflects subsystem responsibilities only; specific data structures for these integrations were not provided in the module documentation.*
