# Code Structure Documentation: Main Application Logic

## Overview
Based on the provided subsystem information, the Main Application Logic subsystem serves as the primary orchestrator for the system. It is responsible for coordinating the rendering pipeline, managing entry points, and handling high-level application flow.

**Note:** The specific code structure (file paths, class names, directory trees) is not provided in the available documentation. The sections below detail the functional responsibilities defined for this subsystem, but the specific implementation structure cannot be determined.

## Functional Scope
The subsystem is organized around the following core responsibilities. However, the specific files, modules, or classes implementing these functions are not documented in the provided data.

*   **PDF Preprocessing:** Handles the scanning of font usage and page dimensions prior to the full rendering process.
*   **HTML Text Line Generation:** Manages the generation and optimization of HTML text lines. This includes logic for state management and clipping.
*   **Graphical Tracing:** Utilizes Cairo contexts to perform graphical tracing, specifically to detect text visibility and occlusion.
*   **Command-Line Interface:** Manages command-line argument parsing and the handling of global parameters.
*   **Utilities:** Provides helper functions for Base64 encoding, string formatting, and the cleanup of temporary files.

## Directory Structure
**Not determined from available documentation.**
(The provided data does not contain file paths or folder hierarchies.)

## Module Organization and Naming Conventions
**Not determined from available documentation.**
(The provided data does not contain specific module names or code files to analyze naming patterns.)

## Key Components and Responsibilities
While specific code components (classes/modules) are not identified, the subsystem logically divides functionality into the following areas based on its defined responsibilities:

1.  **Orchestration Logic:** Central coordination of the rendering pipeline.
2.  **Preprocessing Engine:** Logic for scanning PDF attributes (fonts, dimensions).
3.  **Rendering/Generation Engine:** Logic for creating HTML text lines, including state and clipping.
4.  **Visibility/Occlusion Engine:** Logic for tracing text visibility via Cairo contexts.
5.  **Configuration Layer:** Logic for parsing CLI arguments and managing global parameters.
6.  **Utility Layer:** Shared functions for encoding, formatting, and file cleanup.

## Dependency Graph
**Not determined from available documentation.**
(No import statements or module references were provided in the input data.)

## External Dependencies and Integrations
**Not determined from available documentation.**
(The "technologies" list in the subsystem information is empty, and no dependency files (e.g., `package.json`, `mix.exs`) were provided.)

## Entry Points
**Not determined from available documentation.**
(While the subsystem is described as containing "entry points," specific files or functions acting as entry points are not listed in the provided data.)

## Build Configuration and Tooling
**Not determined from available documentation.**

## Code Patterns and Architectural Decisions
**Not determined from available documentation.**
(No code snippets or architectural descriptions were provided to identify specific design patterns.)

## Layering
**Not determined from available documentation.**
(It is not possible to determine the layering architecture (e.g., Presentation, Logic, Data) without the specific code structure or module definitions.)
