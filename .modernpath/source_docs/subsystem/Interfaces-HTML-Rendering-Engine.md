# HTML Rendering Engine: Interfaces Documentation

## Subsystem Overview
The HTML Rendering Engine is responsible for converting PDF content structures into semantic HTML DOM elements. Its core responsibilities include interpreting and tracking PDF graphics states (such as transformations, fonts, colors, and clipping paths) and converting text streams, images, and vector paths into HTML/CSS elements. Additionally, the subsystem extracts embedded fonts (TrueType, OpenType, Type1) to external files and renders interactive elements like hyperlinks and form widgets.

## APIs & Endpoints
**Status:** Not determined from available documentation.

The provided module documentation for `src/HTMLRenderer` and `test` does not contain explicit definitions for REST or GraphQL endpoints, router configurations, or controller logic. Consequently, no specific API paths or methods can be documented.

## Protocols & Data Formats
**Status:** Not determined from available documentation.

Specific request/response formats, JSON/XML schemas, or communication protocols are not explicitly defined in the provided module documentation. While the subsystem description indicates an input of "PDF content structures" and an output of "semantic HTML DOM elements," the specific interface formats for these exchanges are not detailed in the source text.

## Authentication & Authorization
**Status:** Not determined from available documentation.

No authentication mechanisms, middleware, or authorization logic are present in the provided module documentation.

## Event Systems & Real-time Communication
**Status:** Not determined from available documentation.

There is no evidence of WebSocket implementations, PubSub topics, or message handlers in the provided module documentation.

## External Dependencies & Integrations
**Status:** Not determined from available documentation.

While the subsystem description mentions extracting fonts to "external files," specific external service integrations (HTTP clients, API calls) or library dependencies are not listed in the provided module documentation.

## Architectural Decisions (Interfaces Perspective)
**Status:** Not determined from available documentation.

No specific architectural decisions regarding API versioning, rate limiting, or error handling strategies are evident in the provided module documentation.

## Cross-Module Relationships
**Status:** Not determined from available documentation.

The provided module documentation does not explicitly reference relationships with other modules or subsystems.
