# HTML Rendering Engine - Data Models Documentation

## Subsystem Overview
The HTML Rendering Engine is responsible for converting PDF content structures into semantic HTML DOM elements. According to the subsystem description, its responsibilities include:
*   Interpreting and tracking PDF graphics state (transformations, fonts, colors, clipping paths).
*   Converting PDF text streams, images, and vector paths into HTML/CSS elements.
*   Extracting and dumping embedded fonts (TrueType, OpenType, Type1) to external files.
*   Rendering interactive elements such as hyperlinks and form widgets (inputs, buttons).

## Data Models and Schemas
