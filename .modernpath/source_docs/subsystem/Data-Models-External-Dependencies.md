# External Dependencies: Data Models Documentation

## Subsystem Overview
The External Dependencies subsystem is responsible for managing integrations with external libraries, specifically PDF.js for underlying PDF processing, and ensuring cross-browser compatibility through the implementation of polyfills (e.g., for missing DOM features like `classList`). A key architectural goal is the isolation of vendor code to facilitate updates and manage license compliance separately from the core source.

From a data models perspective, the provided documentation outlines the functional responsibilities of the subsystem (rendering, compatibility, and vendor isolation) but does not explicitly define internal data structures, database schemas, or persistence mechanisms used to achieve these goals.

## Data Structures and Schemas
**Status:** Not determined from available documentation.

The provided module documentation list is empty. Consequently, no database tables, data schemas, or structured data formats are explicitly defined in the available data for this subsystem.

## Entity Definitions and Attributes
**Status:** Not determined from available documentation.

No entity definitions or attribute fields were provided in the module documentation. While the subsystem interacts with external libraries like PDF.js, the specific data entities used to represent these dependencies or their configurations are not defined in the provided text.

## Relationships
**Status:** Not determined from available documentation.

No associations or relationships between entities were defined in the provided data.

## Data Validation and Constraints
**Status:** Not determined from available documentation.

No validation rules, data types, or constraints were provided in the module documentation.

## Persistence and Storage
**Status:** Not determined from available documentation.

The provided documentation does not contain information regarding database persistence, caching strategies, or data migration patterns for this subsystem.

## Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
**Status:** Not determined from available documentation.

An ERD cannot be generated as no schema or relationship definitions were provided in the source data.
