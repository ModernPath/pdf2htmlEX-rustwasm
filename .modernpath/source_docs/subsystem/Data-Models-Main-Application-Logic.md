# Data Models Documentation: Main Application Logic

## Subsystem Overview
The Main Application Logic subsystem is responsible for the primary orchestration of the rendering pipeline. From a data perspective, the subsystem handles information related to PDF preprocessing (specifically font usage and page dimensions), the generation and optimization of HTML text lines (including state management and clipping data), and graphical tracing data for text visibility and occlusion detection.

However, the specific definitions of the data structures, schemas, or persistence mechanisms used to represent these concepts are not provided in the available documentation.

## Data Structures and Schemas
**Not determined from available documentation.**

The provided module documentation for the data models perspective is empty. Consequently, the following details cannot be documented:
*   **Entity Definitions:** Specific fields, attributes, or properties for entities such as PDF pages, HTML text lines, or font records are not defined.
*   **Database Tables:** No database schemas or table definitions are present in the provided inputs.
*   **Data Types and Constraints:** No specific data types (e.g., integers, strings, blobs) or validation constraints are explicitly listed.
*   **State Management Structures:** While the subsystem is responsible for "state management," the actual structure of this state data is not defined.

## Architectural Decisions
**Not determined from available documentation.**

No architectural decisions regarding data modeling, persistence strategies, or schema design are explicitly detailed in the provided inputs. It is not possible to determine how data is stored, retrieved, or validated based solely on the high-level responsibilities list.

## Cross-Module Relationships
**Not determined from available documentation.**

The provided documentation does not specify data relationships or associations (e.g., one-to-many, foreign keys) between different modules or entities within this subsystem.

## External Dependencies and Integrations
**Not determined from available documentation.**

While the subsystem description mentions the use of "Cairo contexts" for graphical tracing and implies the handling of "PDF" and "HTML" formats, specific data model integrations or external schema dependencies (such as specific database connections or external API contracts) are not documented in the provided module list.
