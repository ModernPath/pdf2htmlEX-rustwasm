# Core Utilities: Code Structure Documentation

## Overview
The Core Utilities subsystem is responsible for providing shared helper functions, data structures, and common logic used across the application. It serves as a foundational layer for handling low-level operations.

Based on the provided documentation, the subsystem is organized within the application's source tree, specifically within a `util` subdirectory.

## Directory Structure
The available module documentation explicitly references the following directory structure:

*   **`src`**: The root source directory for the subsystem.
*   **`src/util`**: The specific directory containing the Core Utilities implementation.

**Note:** Detailed file listings, specific filenames, and sub-directories within `src/util` are not determined from the available documentation. The provided module documentation only contains headers for these directories without content details.

## Functional Responsibilities
While the specific code organization within `src/util` is not detailed in the module documentation, the subsystem is defined by the following high-level functional responsibilities:

*   **Filesystem and Path Manipulation**: Handles creation, sanitization, and parsing of paths.
*   **Unicode and Encoding**: Manages Unicode mapping, validation, and encoding for HTML, JSON, and UTF-8.
*   **Geometric Calculations**: Performs matrix transformations and bounding box intersections.
*   **FontForge Integration**: Manages the FontForge library lifecycle and font processing via a C-wrapper.
*   **Platform Abstraction**: Handles platform-specific logic, including MinGW/Windows compatibility and signal handling.

## Implementation Details
*   **Key Components**: Not determined from available documentation. (The module documentation for `src/util` does not list specific files, classes, or functions).
*   **Code Patterns**: Not determined from available documentation.
*   **Architectural Decisions**: Not determined from available documentation.

## Dependencies and Integrations
*   **External Dependencies**: None listed in the provided technologies data.
*   **Internal Dependencies**: Not determined from available documentation (no import graphs or references provided).
*   **Build Configuration**: Not determined from available documentation.

## Relationships
*   **Cross-module Relationships**: Not determined from available documentation.
*   **Layering**: Not determined from available documentation.

## Diagrams
No diagrams can be generated as specific module relationships, file dependencies, or internal structures are not provided in the source data.
